# House Price Prediction
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts house prices based on different features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, and more.
## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to use a **Linear Regression** model to estimate the price of a house using:
- Square Footage  
- Number of Bedrooms  
- Number of Bathrooms  
- Year Built  
- Lot Size  
- Garage Size  
- Neighborhood Quality  
The model is trained on a dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
## 🧠 Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess data (cleaning & scaling)
3. Train-test split
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate using R² and Mean Absolute Error
6. Predict on new house data
## 🚀 How to run
